About the backend/port

This is the readme for the official GPH NovelVM backend (also known as
the GP2X port/GP2XWiz port or Caanoo port).

This is an SVN test release of NovelVM for GPH devices, it would be
appreciated if this SVN test distribution was not mirrored and that
people be directed to http://novelvm.distant-earth.com/ instead for
updated SVN builds.

Fully supported official releases of the GPH NovelVM backend are made in
line with main official releases and are avalalble from the NovelVM
downloads page <https://www.novelvm.org/downloads/> for the GP2X,
GP2XWiz and Caanoo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported audio options
