NovelVM-RASPBERRYPI README
==============================================================================

Notes
============

This version of NovelVM uses SDL2 hardware accelerated graphics, be it
plain SDL2 which in turn uses dispmanx/gles2 or by using gles1 via an
SDL2-configured GLES1 context.

Requirements
============
- Raspberry Pi 1 or 2 microcomputer.
- Raspbian (Debian) installed on SD card. Other distros may be supported if 
  they include the VideoCore runtime libraries that Raspbian includes.
-An attached keyboard and mouse, or alternatively joystick.

Controls
============

The standard NovelVM keyboard and mouse controls are used as in any other 
GNU/Linux based system.
Use the --joystick parameter if you want to use a joystick instead of the
intended mouse for playing the games (not recommended).

Installation from binaries
==============================

We have at least three methods to get the binaries into the Raspbian SD:

1) Since Debian (Raspbian) includes an ssh service by default, I recommend 
keeping the SD card on the Raspberry Pi, and using scp to copy the package over 
to your home directory in the Debian filesystem.

scp novelvm-rpi_<version>.zip pi@<raspberrypi_ip>:/home/pi

2) If your RaspberryPi has internet access, you can simply use wget to 
download the package to your home folder:

cd ~/
wget <package_link>

3) You could also connect the Raspbian SD card to your main PC and, after
mounting it (or being automounted as it would be in most desktop GNU/Linux 
systems), copy the package file manually to your home directory.
How to mount an SD and copy files to it is beyond the scope of this README.

Once we have the package file in our home directory using one of the three 
aforementioned methods, we would need to uncompress it:

unzip novelvm-rpi_<version>.zip

As a result, a directory containing the novelvm along with this README will be
created. 
We can run it by simply changing to our novelvm directory and executing the 
novelvm file.

cd novelvm-rpi
./novelvm

I recommend copying the games to /home/pi/novelvm-rpi. Adding the games via the menu
works as in any other system NovelVM runs on.

Building from sources
==============================

Recommended method is building by cross-compiling on a GNU/Linux X86-based computer.
You can find concise instructions for this on the NovelVM wiki:

https://wiki.novelvm.org/index.php/Compiling_NovelVM/RPI

The configure script is disabling scalers because we prefer dispmanx for that, which 
makes scalers unnecessary on a CPU limited platform like this, timestamps because most people
doesn't have an RTC on the Raspberry Pi, and event recorder to save SD card write cycles.
All these are automatically disabled when we crosscompile by passing "--host=raspberrypi".

Enjoy!
