====================
Welcome to NovelVM!
====================

NovelVM allows you to play classic graphic point-and-click adventure games, text adventure games, and RPGs, as long as you already have the game data files. NovelVM replaces the executable files shipped with the games, which means you can now play your favorite games on all your favorite devices.

So how did NovelVM get its name? Many of the famous LucasArts adventure games, such as Maniac Mansion and the Monkey Island series, were created using a utility called SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion). The 'VM' in NovelVM stands for Virtual Machine. 

While NovelVM was originally designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, over time support has been added for many other games: see the full list `here <https://wiki.novelvm.org/index.php?title=Category:Supported_Games>`_. Noteworthy titles include Broken Sword, Myst and Blade Runner, although there are countless other hidden gems to explore.
