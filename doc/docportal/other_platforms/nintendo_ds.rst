Nintendo DS
=============================

This page contains all the information you need to get NovelVM up and running on a Nintendo DS.

What you'll need
===================

- A homebrew-enabled Nintendo DSi or an unofficial card reader. How to enable homebrew is outside the scope of this documentation.

Installing NovelVM
======================================

Download the Nintendo DS package from the `NovelVM Downloads page <https://www.novelvm.org/downloads/>`_. Extract the archive and copy the extracted ``novelvm.nds`` file onto the SD card. The exact location is not important.

Transferring game files
========================

Transfer game folders onto the SD card. The exact location is not important.

See :doc:`../use_novelvm/game_files` for more information about game file requirements.

Controls
=============

Controls can also be manually configured in the :doc:`Keymaps tab <../settings/keymaps>`. See the :doc:`../use_novelvm/keyboard_shortcuts` page for common keyboard shortcuts.

Paths
=======

Saved games and the configuration file are found in the NovelVM installation directory.

Settings
==========

For more information about Settings, see the Settings section of the documentation. Only platform-specific differences are listed here.

Audio
******

Supported audio file formats:

- MP3
- Uncompressed audio

.. tip::

   Games run faster if audio files are uncompressed.


Known issues
==============

- Games requiring a resolution of 512x512 or higher are not supported on the DS due to hardware limitations.
- Some games are not playable due to the slow CPU speed and limited RAM on the DS. If there are any games that run really slowly, this is considered a hardware limitation, not a bug.
